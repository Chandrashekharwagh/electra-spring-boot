   git clone https://github.com/Chandrashekharwagh/electra-spring-boot-rest-service.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd electra-spring-boot-rest-service
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Using My Spring Boot Example

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Run the application:
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
2. The application will start running at `http://localhost:8080`

## API Endpoints

Here are some example API endpoints:

* GET `/api/resource` - Get all resources
* POST `/api/resource` - Create a new resource
* GET `/api/resource/{id}` - Get a specific resource
* PUT `/api/resource/{id}` - Update a specific resource
* DELETE `/api/resource/{id}` - Delete a specific resource

Postman: Exploring Local Host Connectivity

Postman is a powerful API development and testing tool that allows you to interact with various APIs, including those running on your local host. This README file will guide you through the process of using Postman to interact with a local server.

## Introduction

Postman is a popular tool among developers for testing and interacting with APIs. One of the key features of Postman is its ability to connect to local hosts, which allows you to test and debug your APIs during the development process. By using Postman with a local host, you can quickly and efficiently test your API's functionality without the need to deploy it to a remote server.

## Installing Postman

To get started with Postman, you'll need to download and install the application. Postman is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, and you can download it from the official Postman website (https://www.postman.com/downloads/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system to set up Postman on your local machine.

## Connecting to a Local Host

### Creating a New Request

Once you have Postman installed, you can start creating requests to interact with your local server. To create a new request, follow these steps:

1. Open Postman and click on the "New" button.
2. Select "HTTP Request" from the options.
3. In the "Enter request URL" field, enter the URL for your local server, typically in the format `http://localhost:port/endpoint`.

### Sending a Request to the Local Host

After creating the request, you can send it to your local server by clicking the "Send" button. Postman will make the request to the specified URL and display the response in the response pane.

## Working with Local APIs

### Testing API Endpoints

Postman is an excellent tool for testing and debugging your local API endpoints. You can use Postman to send various HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to your local server and inspect the responses. This can help you identify and fix any issues with your API's implementation.

### Debugging Local API Issues

If you encounter any issues with your local API, Postman can be a valuable tool for debugging. You can use Postman's features, such as the "Headers" and "Body" tabs, to inspect the request and response details, which can help you identify the source of the problem.

## Postman Environment Variables

### Using Environment Variables

Postman supports the use of environment variables, which can be helpful when working with local servers. You can define variables in Postman and use them in your requests, making it easier to manage different configurations (e.g., development, staging, production).

### Managing Environment Variables

Postman allows you to create and manage environment variables through the "Manage Environments" feature. You can create multiple environments and switch between them as needed, ensuring that your requests are using the correct URLs, credentials, and other configuration settings.

## Best Practices

- Use Postman's collection and environment features to organize and manage your API requests.
- Take advantage of Postman's scripting capabilities (using JavaScript) to automate tasks and add dynamic functionality to your requests.
- Leverage Postman's built-in tests and assertions to validate your API responses and ensure the correct functionality.
- Share your Postman collections and environments with your team to facilitate collaboration and consistency.

## Conclusion

Postman is a powerful tool that can greatly simplify the process of testing and debugging your local APIs. By using Postman to interact with your local host, you can quickly identify and address issues during the development process, leading to more robust and reliable applications. This README file has provided an overview of using Postman with a local host, and you can further explore Postman's features and capabilities to enhance your API development workflow.
